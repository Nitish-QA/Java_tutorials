Stream: is for transporting data from one place to another
Two Types:
Input Stream and Output Stream

Input Stream: To read data
Output Stream: To write data

To read data we need to connect keyboard to the input stream. e.g:

Scanner sc  = new Scanner(System.in)
--here "System.in" represents the keyboard

System.in: represents InputStream. Default is keyboard
System.out: represents PrintStream object. Default is monitor
System.err: represents same PrintStream object. But is used to display any error messages in the program.

Byte Stream: are used to handle any characters(text), images, audio and video files
--any class ends with the name Stream represents Byte stream. e.g:
FileInputStream
BufferedInputStream

text Stream: are used to handle dat in the form of character(or text) only.
BufferedReader
InputStreamReader
